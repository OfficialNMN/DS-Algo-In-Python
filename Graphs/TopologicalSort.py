''' In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS 
for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack.
We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological 
sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print 
contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its 
djacent vertices are already in the stack. '''
