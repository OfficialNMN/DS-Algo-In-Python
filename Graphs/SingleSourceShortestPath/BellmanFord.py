'''Dijkstra doesnâ€™t work for Graphs with negative weight edges, Bellman-Ford 
works for such graphs as it can detect a negative cycle if the wiegts are changing 
even after continuing for (V-1) iterations.
Bellman Ford works on Dynamic Programming Approach
Time Complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra.'''
